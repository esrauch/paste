A maintained fork of Paste, which has zero changes from the upstream.


```toml
[dependencies]
paste = { package = "paste-complete", version = "1.0" }
```

# Context 

Paste has been declared "complete" by its author (dtolnay), and he announced the intent not to make any further changes for that reason.

This caused [RUSTSEC-2024-0436](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0436.html) to be created, on the basis that the library is not mainained.

However, this RUSTSEC advisory is problematic in two key ways:

1. It actively drives users to Pastey just to "fix" the advisory. But, realistically the chance of a either accidental regressions in new releases, or supply chain attacks being pushed via Pastey is several orders of magnitude higher than the risk of any security issues in Paste being discovered going forward.

3. It causes noise when people investigate and nearly always arrive at the conclusion that they sholud denylist the RUSTSEC (or else to artifically migrate off of it).

Example issues of this noise include:

* https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/issues/1833
* https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/10356
* https://github.com/private-attribution/ipa/issues/1527
* https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust/issues/2312
* https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/35856
* https://github.com/argmin-rs/argmin/issues/574

## This crate

This crate is a fork of Paste with zero changes, but which is not covered by an abandoned Rustsec by virtue of that it has an self-identified maintainer.

This crate has no intent to make any further releases. In the event of a security issue or similarly critical bug, the maintainer of
this crate (@esrauch) is available to respond to and coordinate the followups.

In the unlikely event of such a situation, the maintainer intends to attempt the fix to be made in the upstream crate, likely by convincing dtolnay to unarchive to accept the patch, or by the crate on crates.io being transferred to some other set of owners.

It is extrodionarily unlikely that it will be subject to any security issues going forward. This crate intends not to publish any versions except for any security sensitive situation.

## Why would anyone use this crate instead of Paste?

Essentially the only reason to dep onto this instead of Paste is because this one is not subject to notices from RUSTSEC which may scare and confuse users of your library.

## Is this really the right way to fix this situation?

Definitely not.

Preferrably the Paste RUSTSEC advisory should be retracted, on the basis that even though its listed as "INFO" in reality it incorrectly causes consternation and concern and the net outcome of the notice is negative. 

Second best outcome is be that crates.io should step in and resolve this issue and move ownership of the paste crate to someone else (including common-rs, etc).

This fork is maintained by Em Rauch who is (at time of publishing) a Staff Engineer at Google who is one of the maintainers of Protobuf, but this fork is not endorsed by Google. In the event that crates.io would only feel comfortable moving ownership of the Paste crate to a sufficiently 'responsible' maintainer, I likely could coordinate owners from Google acting in their role at Google to be subscribed to that.

## I like Pastey, should I not use it?

If you like Pastey you should definitely use it. The author intends to evolve it and add new features, which may be exactly what some people want in their dependency.


Macros for all your token pasting needs

The nightly-only [`concat_idents!`] macro in the Rust standard library is
notoriously underpowered in that its concatenated identifiers can only refer to
existing items, they can never be used to define something new.

[`concat_idents!`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.concat_idents.html

This crate provides a flexible way to paste together identifiers in a macro,
including using pasted identifiers to define new items.

```toml
[dependencies]
paste = "1.0"
```

This approach works with any Rust compiler 1.31+.

<br>

## Pasting identifiers

Within the `paste!` macro, identifiers inside `[<`...`>]` are pasted together to
form a single identifier.

```rust
use paste::paste;

paste! {
    // Defines a const called `QRST`.
    const [<Q R S T>]: &str = "success!";
}

fn main() {
    assert_eq!(
        paste! { [<Q R S T>].len() },
        8,
    );
}
```

<br>

## More elaborate example

The next example shows a macro that generates accessor methods for some struct
fields. It demonstrates how you might find it useful to bundle a paste
invocation inside of a macro\_rules macro.

```rust
use paste::paste;

macro_rules! make_a_struct_and_getters {
    ($name:ident { $($field:ident),* }) => {
        // Define a struct. This expands to:
        //
        //     pub struct S {
        //         a: String,
        //         b: String,
        //         c: String,
        //     }
        pub struct $name {
            $(
                $field: String,
            )*
        }

        // Build an impl block with getters. This expands to:
        //
        //     impl S {
        //         pub fn get_a(&self) -> &str { &self.a }
        //         pub fn get_b(&self) -> &str { &self.b }
        //         pub fn get_c(&self) -> &str { &self.c }
        //     }
        paste! {
            impl $name {
                $(
                    pub fn [<get_ $field>](&self) -> &str {
                        &self.$field
                    }
                )*
            }
        }
    }
}

make_a_struct_and_getters!(S { a, b, c });

fn call_some_getters(s: &S) -> bool {
    s.get_a() == s.get_b() && s.get_c().is_empty()
}
```

## Case conversion

Use `$var:lower` or `$var:upper` in the segment list to convert an interpolated
segment to lower- or uppercase as part of the paste. For example, `[<ld_
$reg:lower _expr>]` would paste to `ld_bc_expr` if invoked with $reg=`Bc`.

Use `$var:snake` to convert CamelCase input to snake\_case.
Use `$var:camel` to convert snake\_case to CamelCase.
These compose, so for example `$var:snake:upper` would give you SCREAMING\_CASE.

The precise Unicode conversions are as defined by [`str::to_lowercase`] and
[`str::to_uppercase`].

[`str::to_lowercase`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html#method.to_lowercase
[`str::to_uppercase`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html#method.to_uppercase

<br>

## Pasting documentation strings

Within the `paste!` macro, arguments to a #\[doc ...\] attribute are implicitly
concatenated together to form a coherent documentation string.

```rust
use paste::paste;

macro_rules! method_new {
    ($ret:ident) => {
        paste! {
            #[doc = "Create a new `" $ret "` object."]
            pub fn new() -> $ret { todo!() }
        }
    };
}

pub struct Paste {}

method_new!(Paste);  // expands to #[doc = "Create a new `Paste` object"]
```
